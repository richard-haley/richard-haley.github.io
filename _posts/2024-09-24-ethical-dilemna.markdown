title: "Ethical Dilemna"
---


I am a computer scientist.  I’ve been one for 48 years.  I’ve been a professional software engineer for 34 of them, unless you count the peculiar contract programming I did for the prior three years.



I have run into a Catch-22 of sorts.  When I took my first programming class, the only one my college offered at the time, the IBM 8088/8086 was still four years in the future.  My computer mentors advised me to ignore the BA plans I had and go directly to programming classes, which I did, and which I aced.  But that’s it.  I’ve got a PhD’s worth of credit hours, but no degree in anything.



This didn’t mean a lot before the development of the *Application Tracking System” software line.   It scans applications with a completely artificial eye.  A human would look at my resume and have questions, but a computer simply rejects it.



The question becomes then, “Is it moral to lie to the system?”
